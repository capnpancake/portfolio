                I am thankful for the opportunities that I have been provided during my life. Now that I have a degree, I am ready to show the world that I am a worthy developer. Plenty of experience in team environments have prepared me for the career that I am entering. My adaptive learning and problem solving skills have been tempered by my journey through the food and supply chain industries. Having climbed the degree-less ladder for a while, I am ready to set my sights on new horizons with the knowledge and skills I have obtained and am obtaining through higher education.

                Like many, I started in the food industry. Even though serving food is a modest occupation, there is much to take away from the experience. Time management, organization, problem solving, working under pressure, teamwork, and customer service are essential to any organization - and a restaurant is no exception. I will never forget my days working in restaurants and will continue to appreciate those who serve my food when I decide to eat out.

                I found my way into Gordon Hospital through its housekeeping department. After cleaning patient rooms for a few months and learning how crucial a clean environment is to maintaining patient safety and health, a position opened up in Materials Management for a Receiving Clerk. Before I knew it, I was the Materials Analyst performing cost analysis and maintaining warehouse efficiency. I have been successful in channeling the skills I learned in the food industry to force my way up the ranks.

                My true desire is to design and build software. I currently have my Associate's of Applied Science majoring in Computer Programming and am a certified Java programmer. I intend to further my education and use these tools to develop innovative software for personal and occupational reasons.
